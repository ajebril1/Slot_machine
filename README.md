# Slot Machine Game ðŸŽ°  

Hello there!   

Welcome to my Python-based Slot Machine game! This is a fun little project I created to practice working with Python fundamentals like loops, functions, and dictionaries while also incorporating a bit of randomness for that real slot machine experience.  

## How It Works  

1. **Deposit Money:** Start by depositing an amount of your choice to play the game.  
2. **Choose Lines:** Decide how many lines you want to bet on (up to 3 lines).  
3. **Place Your Bet:** Set your bet per line within the allowed range.  
4. **Spin the Machine:** The slot machine spins, and if you win, your balance increases based on the symbol values!  
5. **Quit Anytime:** You can leave the game with your remaining balance whenever you want.  

## Features  

- **Randomized Spins:** The symbols shuffle every spin for a dynamic experience.  
- **Customizable Symbols:** The game uses a dictionary to manage symbol counts and values, making it easy to tweak.  
- **Dynamic Lines:** Bet on 1, 2, or 3 lines to increase your chances of winning.  
- **User-Friendly:** Clear instructions and feedback guide you through the game.  

## Technologies Used  

- **Language:** Python   
- **Libraries:** Random (for symbol selection)  

## Things I Learned  

While building this, I got to practice concepts like:  
- Managing user input validation.  
- Implementing dynamic functions for reusability.  
- Using nested loops and lists to simulate the slot machine grid.  
- Transposing a matrix to print the slot machine properly.  

## How to Run  

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.  
3. Run the `main()` function and follow the prompts to play the game.  

## Whatâ€™s Next?  

Iâ€™m thinking about adding:  
- A feature to save and load progress.  
- More symbols and lines to increase the complexity.  
- A betting limit to make it feel more like a real slot machine.  

Feel free to share your thoughts or suggestions! Iâ€™d love to improve this project further.
